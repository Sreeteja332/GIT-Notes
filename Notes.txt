git init: to initialize the git 

git status: To check the status of the git 

create a File/folder in that directory and go to git status

git add ./git add -all: to add all of them to the line

then check status it will be tracked

git commit: to commit every thing

vi filename.txt can add data in the file 

cat flinename.txt to check the contents in the file

git restore --staged filename.txt: it will remove that file form stage and you have to commit again to add it again to the stage

git log : to see all the updates

rm -rf filename.txt to remove file form the commit and if you check status of that file it will show that this file has been deleted

if u want to remove this deleted commit i.e, that if u want to unstage that commit(deletion) u have to copy that exactly below commits code by :git reset COMMITCODE
that removed files will be there in the staged area.

And if u want to keep them backstage that file and use it later i.e, :git stash
